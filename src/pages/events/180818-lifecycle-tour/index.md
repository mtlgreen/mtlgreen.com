*LA VERSION FRANÇAISE SUIT*

Interested in finding out where your recycling actually goes? Or where your food-scraps bide their time as they wait to turn to compost?

Join us for a life-cyle tour: a visit into the heart of Montreal’s recycling eco-system!

To discover the life cycle journey of recoverable materials around us, MtlGreen is organizing a series of themed visits for interested citizens.

Each theme will include two pit-stops in the life-cycle journey of the material: a “creator” (which transforms recycled materials, to products or produce we use every day) and a “recoverer” (which recovers or recycles what we throw away). The visit will also include information on how waste management happens in Montreal, to help you become more knowledgeable about your city, and so you can share with your friends & family.

This first edition will focus on: Plastic!

Meet our lifecyle stops!

1. Creator : TBD

2. Recoverer : TBD
